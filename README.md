#### The goal is to predict which parts will fail quality control to reduce manufacturing failures.

- The data represents measurements of parts as they move through Bosch's production lines.

- They are very sparse: *81% empty.* The classes are highly imbalanced: *0.58% failed.*

   *[Cluster based on shared features](src/clustering.py)*

   *[Perform principal component analysis on each cluster](src/pca.py)*

   *[Use various classification algorithms on each cluster](src/training.py)*
