# QC-Classification

### Classifying if manufactured parts will pass or fail quality control.

Given a part with any of 950 possible measurements, it will be determined if it will pass or fail quality control.

This can be useful in any manufacturing setting, so that the quality control phase can be skipped, saving time and energy.

This is done by first grouping the part based on what measurements it has with parts which have been measured and labeled as either a pass or a fail before it. Depending on what group it lands in, it will either me classified based on `[Logisitic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Forest]`

The Matthews correlation coefficient was used to judge how well the model does.


* An in-depth explanation of your process
* What algorithms and techniques did you use?
* What interesting insights did you gain?
* How to run on my own
* Give instructions for how to run your code on their computer (e.g. Run python scraper.py to collect the data, then run...)
