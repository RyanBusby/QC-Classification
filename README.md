# __Binary Classification__

#### The goal is to predict which parts will fail quality control to reduce manufacturing failures.

- The data represents measurements of parts as they move through Bosch's production lines.

- They are very sparse: *81% empty.* The classes are highly imbalanced: *0.58% failed.*

__My approach:__
1. [Cluster based on shared features](clustering.ipynb)
2. [Perform principal component analysis on each cluster](PCA.ipynb)
3. [Use various classification algorithms on each cluster](training.ipynb)
